# pyVISA communication library for the Siglent SDG1000X function generator series as an arbitrary waveform generator. 

This Jupyter Lab document implements a pyVISA communication library to send SCPI commands & data to the Siglent SDG1000X arbitrary waveform generator series via LAN (but any other way can be used, such as USB). This library was tested using a SDG1062X.
